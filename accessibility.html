    <h2 class="subheader">Accessibility Research</h2>
 <p>As the web’s usage becomes globally widespread, it’s scope and importance reaches new levels. The web has become imperative for daily life throughout the world. From uses in medicine and research, to uses in communication and information sharing, the web is required for jobs in almost all industries. The education system also depends on the web, especially in the current moment where most students are learning and participating remotely. “Almost 4.57 billion people were active internet users as of July 2020, encompassing 59 percent of the global population. China, India and the United States rank ahead all other countries in terms of internet users” (J. Clement).
The widespread usage of the web has amplified the importance of accessibility. The goal of accessibility is enabling the utilization of the web to all people, regardless of their software, language, ability, disability, and location. When a website is accessible, its content can be perceived and navigated by anyone with any disability. As the W3C website states, “Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including: auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, visual.” The necessity and complexity of accessibility is further amplified by the vast scope of browsers and portals people are currently using to access the web.
The web designer community has fully supported the accessibility standards and there are many resources for learning about accessibility, as well as learning how to implement accessibility standards into your website. The WC3 breaks accessibility standards into three groups for easy comprehension: web content, user agents, and authoring tools. “Accessible sites present information through multiple sensory channels, such as sound and sight, and they allow for additional means of site navigation and interactivity beyond the typical point-and-click-interface: keyboard-based control and voice-based navigation. The combination of a multisensory approach and a multi-interactivity approach allows disabled users to access the same information as nondisabled users (Usability.gov).” For further understanding of these standards, the W3C has published a comprehensive list of their standards and how to implement them at W3 Accessibility Principles. 
As web designers, we must embrace the importance of accessibility and implement its guidelines into all of our websites. By advancing and maintaining accessibility, we ensure the necessary use of the web for all.
