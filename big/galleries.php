    <p>A responsive photo gallery is important to many types of websites. Image galleries are useful for visual representation, brand promotion, advertising, and boosting  a website in google search. “Research has shown that when we engage with information that has a visual element attached to it,  we are likely to retain 65% of it 3 days later. This, as opposed to a mere 10% of the information when it is lacking in accompanied imagery” (Leonov). There are tons of different ways to go about including a responsive image gallery, such as a HTML slideshow or an image grid. Image galleries may be coded in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jquery. As a web designer, we can code our own from scratch, or use one of the many templates that are open to use on the internet.</p>
<p>One great resource is the W3Schools “How to Lightbox page”. This page walks through creating a lightbox gallery using Modals and Slideshows code. It provides you with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript language needed. The jQuery UI Demos page shows you how to use the jQuery slider (as well as many other jQuery actions). This is a great tool for any developer. The Mozilla Developer tools also has an image galleries page and how to build them using Javascript. This page really breaks down each step of the coding process so that even a beginner could implement these interactive tools into a website. There are many resources on the web for interactive image galleries. It just takes a little searching and reading to understand how to implement them.
