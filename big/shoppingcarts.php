<p>There are many different types of websites that need to utilize a shopping cart online, from small non-profits to the biggest brands we all know. Martinez writes, “Your e-commerce web hosting platform usually comes with a shopping cart, but we recommend deciding which one works best for you on your own. When you're considering which type of shopping chart you'd like to integrate, consider the type of store you're operating, the nature of your target audience, and how you prefer to sell the products or services you'll offer.”</p>
<p>Looking through the many comparisons of shopping cart platforms on the web, it's clear that there are innumerable choices, which all receive different rankings for different reasons. According to <a href="https://financesonline.com/comparison-15-leading-shopping-cart-software-systems/" target="_blank">financesonline.com</a>, some of the top recommended platforms are: Salesforce Commerce cloud, Wix.com, Shopify, BigCommerce, Magento, and Squarespace. Clearly, deciding which platform to use depends greatly on the requirements of the website.</p>
<p>One way to compare carts is based on price. Sometimes a lower price up front means way more fees down the road. “Some carts may be really cheap but charge fees for transactions and for add-ons that let you integrate with other third-party tools. Depending on your requirements, you can look at prices as low as $9.99 and as high as thousands of dollars per month” (Martinez).</p>
<p>You also need to consider which features your shopping cart platform needs to include. “Some shopping carts are better suited for selling physical goods while others can support digital and virtual products, such as ebooks, file downloads, and even services. You need to think about the types of products you want to sell before selecting a shopping cart service” (Martinez). </p>
<p>Another important consideration is the security of the platform. Make sure your store is equipped with a SSL certificate, for the security of both you and your customers. There are many considerations when choosing a e-commerce platform, and thankfully many of them have tutorials and trials to see before you commit. </p>
