    <p>I am a student in the Web Design track at Seattle College. This is only my second class in Web Authoring, but I feel like we learned so much in the first class. I'm excited to keep it up! I started this track this past summer because I am looking to pivot into web design. <br/>
    I'm most interested in the design aspects of web authoring, probably because I am a textile weaver and love playing with color and shapes and pattern. I'm hoping to gain enough technical skills in web authoring so that I can implement my visual interests. I'm looking forward to learning everything I can in this course.</p>
